Junk Drawer
==========================

Everyone has ideas for applications, but not all of them are great.
Some are original but lacking in functionality while others have been done before and need a new twist on them to make them more interesting and useful. 

The idea behind Junk Drawer is to create a platform for the Open Source community to 
put all of their ideas in. However, this isn't just a common forum. When you post your idea, you will be given 24 hours before it is removed alltogether. Your goal is to get as many up votes as possible. If you dont have enough, then your idea will be removed to make room for newer ones. If you do have enough, your idea will be moved to a different queue. Here, instead of receiving comments that may not be relevant or directly useful, users can sift and search through all of the other ideas in the queue and link them together. By linking them, we can take two similar but incomplete ideas and merge them together in order to make one bigger and better idea. As opposed to a simple forum, linking each idea will provide a more focused way to collaborate.

TODO:
==============================

The final page would have the projects and their linked ideas in a separate queue. In here they will be marked as "in progress" with a link to a repository and any contributors involved.



SETUP:
==================================

Take the sql file in /sql and import it into a MySQL database. Configure the Slim application in /php by modifying php/php/config/config.php. Here is where you will define database connection options.

In Handles.cs, change the Base URL to your own handle. I can't guarantee my website will host this forever.
